Class A is the main class

Class B is inside Class A and handles comparing references


The following are values in Class A:

- Class B

- stream

- buffer

- buffer position

- dictionary



The following are functions in Class A:

- A default function that sets the values

- A function that dispose the stream

- A function that writes data on disk

- A function that checks there is a min amount of space for buffer

- A function that writes a boolean

- A function that writes a byte

- A function that writes a signed byte

- A function that writes a short

- A function that writes a unsigned short

- A function that writes an int

- A function that writes an unsigned int

- A function that writes a long

- A function that writes an unsigned long

- A function that writes a double

- A function that writes a string

- A function that writes an array of bytes

- A function that writes an array of shorts

- A function that writes an array of primitives

- A function that writes an byte in a fix length

- A function that writes a short in a fix length

- A function that writes an int in a fix length

- A function that writes an primitive array in a fix length

- A function that writes a bulk of primitive data from given array

- A function that writes an array of items

- A function that writes a list of items

- A function that writes a hash set

- A function that writes a sorted set

- A function that writes a dictionary

- A function that writes a nullable object

- A function that writes optional object

- A function that writes object reference

- A function that writes null object reference
