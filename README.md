# Relight-Docs
The clean-room documentation of UE

This file is highly recommended for C++ and .h files, as these files cannot directly be studied and change unlike something like C#

## Reminder! This doc contains the original Architecture of Unreal Engine, please refer to /Doc/ for details of the revamped Relight Architecture!
